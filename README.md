## Warframe Central
# A React API Tracker for Warframe
This project was created purely for fun, the goal of this application is to function as a single page application displaying latest stats, times, loot drops, and etc so a player could effectively track when to log in and play Warframe.

This application is client-side only developed with React, future plans include a complete server & client solution.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
